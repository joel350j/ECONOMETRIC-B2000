#In the test group we can see a negative value showing the relationship between population housing cost and its level of income. So it confirms the hypothesis that the majority canâ€™t afford buying a place to live.
plot(test_data)
#The test group is showing the same characteristic as the trained group. Only a very tiny number within this population would live in their owned place and is reflected by that single dot.

pairs(train_data)
plot(cl_data)
#The best practice was to normalize the data and finally run the k-nn algorithms and compare against the simple means. 
#We can notice that income levels justify needs and confirm capabilities. Our sampled community cannot really afford living in owned places and seem to be more inclined to rent. 
#As we can see in the last plots, higher concentrations of renters are reflected in the Bronx and Brooklyn. The simplicity of K-nn algorithms facilitates the understanding of relationships between income levels, borough, level of education. 
#Our perception would be to guess that other factors could influence the data. However, better sampling could not be made to show these results.
