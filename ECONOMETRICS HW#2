#Overall Goal: Using PUMS data, consider how outcomes of interest vary with college major choice. 
#Groups should prepare a 1-min presentation by one of the group members about their experiment process and results. You get 45 min to prepare.
#For now don’t get lost in looking at every major but maybe pick a couple of majors to compare (for example, Econ & Psych, but now I’ve stolen that idea so pick a different one).

#Now consider the experiment protocol after peeking at some of the data. You’re implicitly comparing a subgroup, of those people who finished a 4-year degree and reported information. 
#What additional restrictions might you impose? Should you include retired people? People not in the labor force?
#Looking at that subgroup, what is the size of the difference in outcome? 
#What is the standard error of that difference measure? Using your stats knowledge, how confident are you, that the difference is actually there and not an artefact of sampling?
#Look at the crosstabs and compute the marginal probabilities. 
#How do those inform? To check if you did it right, compute some of the marginal probabilities using Bayes’ Theorem. Is your crosstab mutually exclusive and exhaustive?
